=head1 NAME

Sprocket::Plugin - Base class for Sprocket plugins

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Sprocket qw( Plugin );
  use base qw( Sprocket::Plugin );

  sub new {
      shift->SUPER::new(
          name => 'MyPlugin',
          @_
      );
  }

  sub as_string {
      __PACKAGE__;
  }

  ...

=head1 ABSTRACT

This is a base class for Sprocket plugins.  It provides several default methods
for easy plugin implementation.

=head1 NOTES

A plugin can define any of the methods below.  All are optional, but a plugin
should have a conncted and a receive method for it to function.  See the
Sprocket site for examples.  L<http://sprocket.cc/>  Plugins should use the
template in the SYNOPSIS.

Also, this module is a subclass of L<Class::Accessor::Fast>, so subclasses of 
L<Sprocket::Plugin> can create accessors like so (in your new() method):

  __PACKAGE__->mk_accessors( qw( foo bar baz ) );

=head1 EVENTS

=head2 Server Event Methods

These are methods that can be defined in a plugin for Sprocket server instances

=over 4

=item local_accept

Called with ( $self, $server, $con, $socket )
Defining this method is optional.  The default behavior is to accept the
connection.  You can call $con->reject() or $con->accept() to reject or
accept a connection.  You can also call $self->take_connection( $con );
in this phase.  See L<Sprocket::Connection> for more information on the
accept and reject methods.

=item local_connected

Called with ( $self, $server, $con, $socket )
This is the last chance for a plugin to take a connection with
$self->take_connection( $con );  You should apply your filters for the
connection in this method.  See L<Sprocket::Connection> for details on how
to access the connection's filters.

=item local_receive

Called with ( $self, $server, $con, $data )
$data is the data from the filter applied to the connection.

Note: A connection's active time doesn't update automaticly for this event.
You can call $con->active(), see L<Sprocket::Connection>.

=item local_disconnected

Called with ( $self, $server, $con, $error )
If error is true, then $operation, $errnum, and $errstr will also be defined
after $error.   If a connection was closed with $con->close() then $error
will be false.  If a connection was closed remotely but without an error then
$error will be true, but $errnum will be 0.  For more details, see ErrorEvent
in L<POE::Wheel::ReadWrite>.

=item local_error

Called with ( $self, $server, $operation, $errnum, $errstr )
This is only called when there is an error with the server wheel, like a bind
error.

    use Errno qw( EADDRINUSE EACCES );
    $server->shutdown() if ( $errnum == EADDRINUSE || $errnum == EACCES );

The default behavior is to shutdown the server if there is a bind error.

=item local_time_out

Called with ( $self, $server, $con, $time )
A time out occurred on the connection.  This means the $con->active_time +
$con->time_out is less than $time.  You can choose to $con->close() or not.
The default behavior is to close the connection.  This event will only occur
if you have set a time out with $con->set_time_out( $seconds )

=item local_shutdown

Called with ( $self, $server, $con )
This is currently only called when a soft shutdown is initiated.  You should
make cleanup arrangements and close the connection asap.  The server will wait
for all connections to close.  See the shutdown command in L<Sprocket::Server>,
and L<Sprocket::Client>.

=back

=head2 Client Event Methods

These are methods that can be defined in a plugin for Sprocket client instances

=over 4

=item remote_accept

Why is there an accept method for client connections?!
Well, good question.  This method is here to allow you to set the filters
and blocksize using the $con-accept method.  See L<Sprocket::Connection>

See local_accept.

=item remote_connected

See local_connected.

=item remote_receive

See local_receive.

=item remote_disconnected

See local_disconnected.
You can call $con->reconnect() to attempt to reconnect to the host.

=item remote_connect_error

Called with ( $self, $client, $con )
If a connection wasn't attempted due to a DNS issue, $response_error,
and $response_obj from L<POE::Component::DNS> will follow $con.  The 
remote_disconnected event will not be called. You can call $con->reconnect()
to attempt to reconnect to the host.

=item remote_time_out

Called with ( $self, $client, $con, $time )
A time out occurred on the connection.  This means the $con->active_time +
$con->time_out is less than $time.  You can choose to $con->close() or not.
The default behavior is to close the connection.  This event will only occur
if you have set a time out with $con->set_time_out( $seconds )

=item remote_shutdown

See local_shutdown.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item $self->con_id_list

Returns a list of connection ids currently active conenctions taken by
the plugin.  Use $sprocket->get_connection() to get the connection reference.
Note: con_id_list in a scalar context will return an array ref

  foreach ( $self->con_id_list ) {
      if ( my $con = $sprocket->get_connection( $_ ) ) {
          $con->send( "you are client:".$con->ID );
      }
  }

=item $self->take_connection( $con )

Assigns the connection to your plugin.  Usually done during the accept or
connect phase.

=item release_connection( $con );

=item spread_subscribe( [ 'group1', 'group2' ] );

=item spread_unsubscribe( [ 'group1', 'group2' ] );

=item spread_publish( [ 'group1', 'group2' ], $message, @etc );
