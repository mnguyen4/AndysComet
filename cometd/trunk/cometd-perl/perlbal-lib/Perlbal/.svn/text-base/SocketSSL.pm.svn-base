# Base class for SSL sockets.
#
# This is a simple class that extends Danga::Socket and contains an IO::Socket::SSL
# for the purpose of allowing non-blocking SSL in Perlbal.
#
# WARNING: this code will break IO::Socket::SSL if you use it in any plugins or
# have custom Perlbal modifications that use it.  you will run into issues.  This
# is because we override the close method to prevent premature closure of the socket,
# so you will end up with the socket not closing properly.
